# Extracting Event Statistics from QRadar using Python Code

This is an example of the entire pipeline how you can leverage QRadar to 
aggregate data, extract it and then process it in an external tool
like Python or RStudio.

Depending on what you discover with your analysis you can then feed that 
information back into the SIEM as harvested threat intel or you can enrich
what ever other systems you have in your environment.

Depending on the data you extract, you can then of course apply ML and
other models to your data.
